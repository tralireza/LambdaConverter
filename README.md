Concept for Lambda FFMPEG Converter
===

Idea
Basically, we use a standalone ffmpeg/ffprobe next to our "bootstrap.go" Lambda.
Go function arranges a copy of the input file (audio/video) with a GET from AWS S3 to local "ephemeral" storage (Max: 10G) then calls ffmpeg with correct conversion parameters. The output generated by the conversion is then copied back to the S3 with a PUT.

Using go as the Lambda bootstrap is boosted by AWS SDK for Go.

Host
```
i7:~/ffmpeg $ uname -a
Linux i7.domain.local 6.5.5-rt22 #19 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Oct  2 16:05:41 BST 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

"ffprobe"
Statically linked:
I have compiled ffmpeg/ffprobe statically so there is no dependency on the dynamic libraries. The ELF binary is LIBC 2.34 which is supported by the Lambda layer "provided.al2034" the runs the Go Lambda function.

ffprobe is as follows:

```
i7:~/ffmpeg $ file ffprobe
ffprobe: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=e651d703779d81d45ec309224e3ac9fb4360baee, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```

"Lambada"
Go "bootstrap.go" that will interface AWS Lambda to ffprobe/ffmpeg and complete GET/PUT to S3 using aws-skd-go https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go
